We can rewrite this equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) by isolating y:\n\n2y = -3x - 4\ny = (-3/2)x - 2\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that the slope of the given line is -3/2.\n\nThe negative reciprocal of -3/2 is 2/3, so the slope of the line we are looking for is 2/3.\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope form of a line (y - y1 = m(x - x1)) to find the equation of the line passing through the given point (2, 3) with the slope 2/3.\n\nUsing the point (2, 3) and the slope 2/3, the equation of the line can be written as:\n\ny - 3 = (2/3)(x - 2)\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can distribute (2/3) to (x - 2):\n\ny - 3 = (2/3)x - (4/3)\n\nTo get rid of the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 3:\n\n3(y - 3) = 2x - 4\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n3y - 9 = 2x - 4\n\nFinally, we can rearrange the equation to have the standard form of a line:\n\n2x - 3y = -5\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line passing through (2, 3) and perpendicular to the line 3x + 2y + 4 = 0 is 2x - 3y = -5."]}], "tstamp": 1699414481.7252882}
