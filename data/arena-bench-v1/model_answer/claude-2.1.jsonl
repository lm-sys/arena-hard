An important concept in psychology and decision-making. Let me try to explain this in a clear and simple way. \n\nImagine you're baking cookies. The recipe calls for 2 cups of flour. But when you go to measure out the flour, you accidentally spill some and it looks like you only have around 1.5 cups in the measuring cup. Not wanting to get more flour out, you decide, \"Eh, close enough,\" and use the 1.5 cups. That's an example of a cognitive bias - your brain taking a mental shortcut and making a less than optimal judgment.\n\nCognitive biases are essentially mental blindspots that lead to distortions in how we perceive information and make decisions. They cause us to draw incorrect conclusions or make less than ideal choices without us realizing it. Some common examples are confirmation bias (paying more attention to information that confirms our existing beliefs), the halo effect (judging someone as generally good because you like one aspect of them), and optimism bias (believing you're less likely to experience something negative compared to others).\n\nThese biases exist because our brains have limited mental bandwidth and use shortcuts to quickly process the huge amount of information we deal with daily. They usually happen unconsciously. The key is bringing awareness to these biases so we can recognize when they occur and adjust our thinking.\n\nIn summary, cognitive biases are systematic thinking errors our brains make all the time. They lead to distorted thought patterns and poor decisions. Recognizing them is the first step to minimizing how much they impact us."]}], "tstamp": 1701055048.9817998}

If not linear, transformations (e.g. log, sqrt) of the variables may help.\n\n2. Homoscedasticity - The variance of the residuals (errors) is constant across the values of the independent variables. This can be checked by plotting the residuals vs predicted values and looking for any funnel shape. If the variance is not constant, weighted least squares or transformations of the dependent variable may help. \n\n3. Normality of residuals - The residuals are normally distributed. A histogram or Q-Q plot of the residuals can check this in Quarto. If the residuals are not normal, transformations of the variables may help. Extreme outliers can also be removed.\n\n4. No multicollinearity - The independent variables are not too highly correlated with each other. Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) can be calculated for each independent variable to detect multicollinearity issues. If found, dropping one of the highly correlated variables may help. \n\n5. No autocorrelation - The residuals are independent from each other. The Durbin-Watson test can assess this. Autocorrelation is more common in time series data.

However, it failed to achieve widespread adoption except in a few countries like South Korea. This paper analyzes the factors that led to the successful implementation and social adoption of PKI technology in South Korea.\n\nBackground on Public-Key Infrastructure  \n\nPKI refers to a system for the creation, storage, distribution and revocation of digital certificates which are used to verify the identity of users and devices in an online transaction. It enables trusted and secure electronic communication and commerce. PKI provides authentication, data confidentiality, data integrity and non-repudiation.\n\nUntil the late 1990s, technology forecasters predicted that PKI would become essential for activities like e-commerce and e-governance across the world. However, the complexity and high costs of implementing PKI meant that adoption rates remained low globally, except for a few countries like South Korea.\n\nPKI Adoption in South Korea\n\nUnlike most other countries, South Korea has seen widespread adoption of PKI technology. By the early 2000s, South Korea already had the highest number of certified users globally. By 2021, around 80% of internet users had public-key certificates compared to less than 5% in the United States.\n\nThe public sector drove early adoption of PKI in South Korea in the 1990s. Government initiatives like the Public Key Infrastructure Act of 1999 and the Cyber Sign Law of 2002 mandated the use of digital signatures and certificates for activities like taxes, customs, social security services etc. This primed the Korean market for citizen adoption of PKI.\n\nFactors Driving PKI Adoption in South Korea \n\n1. Government mandates and subsidies for PKI\n2. High internet penetration and tech-savvy population\n3. Cultural willingness to share personal information online\n4. Rise of online financial transactions and need for security\n\nAnalysis  \n\nGovernment policies and population attributes intersected uniquely in South Korea to enable social adoption of complex technology like PKI. The seeds sown by early public sector adoption were reaped by the private sector through electronic banking and e-commerce. \n\nMandatory use of PKI for government services familiarized Koreans with the technology, while subsidies reduced cost barriers to individual adoption. High broadband connectivity and digital literacy meant that users were able and willing to utilize digital certificates.\n\nAdditionally, cultural attitudes towards privacy and sharing of personal information helped Koreans overcome one of the main barriers to PKI adoption - privacy concerns related to identity authentication. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe Korean model of PKI adoption stands apart for its scale and societal penetration. Policymakers aiming to implement complex technologies can draw key lessons from Korea on the importance of public sector leadership and constructive regulation in priming technology adoption."]}], "tstamp": 1701054382.6866312}

Methods like PATE and RAPPOR can help too.\n\n- Employ recent algorithms like PATE-G and DP-Adam that are specifically designed for differentially private training of machine learning models. They provide rigorous privacy guarantees with minimal impact on model accuracy.\n\n- Use a technique called privacy amplification by iteration to get very high privacy guarantees for a small privacy budget. This trains models iteratively and composes the privacy guarantees.\n\n- Leverage advances like batch normalization and regularization that improve generalization of models. This allows getting good accuracy even with the noise added for privacy.\n\n- Carefully select hyperparameters like batch size, noise levels, and gradient norms to balance privacy and accuracy goals. This requires empirical evaluation to find the sweet spot.\n\n- Pre-train language models on public domain data before fine-tuning on private data. This improves utility significantly compared to training only on private data.\n\n- Use federated learning and on-device training where possible to keep private data decentralized. This provides privacy by data minimization.\n\n- Rigorously account for privacy loss at each step using techniques like privacy odometers and zero-knowledge proofs.

Currently, Victoria is the only state that has legalised voluntary assisted dying, which will come into effect mid-2019. The Northern Territory legalised euthanasia briefly from 1996-1997 before the laws were overturned by the Federal Parliament. Other states have considered similar legislation but not passed it yet.\n\nThe debate around euthanasia focuses on difficult questions about the balance between patient autonomy, protecting vulnerable people, medical ethics, and the role of palliative care. Reasonable people can disagree in good faith on this sensitive issue. As laws develop, the strengths and weaknesses of each state\u2019s approach are becoming clearer:  \n\nState Laws  Strengths Weaknesses\nVictoria  Voluntary assisted dying legalised in 2017, coming into effect mid-2019. Strict eligibility criteria and oversight aim to allow choice for terminally ill patients while protecting against abuse. Does not cover patients with chronic/severe suffering if not near end-of-life. Complex procedures could disadvantage patients. Laws still untested in real situations.\nWestern Australia Voluntary assisted dying bill defeated by one vote in Parliament in 2017. Public supports reform but political/ethical concerns remain among some. Bill was restrictive e.g. only for terminally ill patients. A revised bill is expected in the future after consultation. Lack of law reform causes ongoing suffering for some patients. \nQueensland A parliamentary inquiry in early 2020 will advise on voluntary assisted dying reform. Queensland Law Reform Commission proposed a legal framework. Building political momentum for change Public consultation underway Progress slower than some advocates desire. Proposed laws may still be restrictive depending on final recommendations.\nNew South Wales and Other States No formal laws yet, but parliamentary groups and advocates pushing for reform. Medical professionals can follow guidelines to alleviate suffering at end of life. Palliative care/hospice well developed in some areas. Ongoing suffering for some terminal patients who desire choice around timing of their death. Lack of legal clarity for doctors. \n\nThe path to change may be long, as governments tread cautiously in this complex field. But many Australians hope their state will eventually follow Victoria\u2019s lead in allowing choice for terminally ill patients who are suffering unbearably at the end of life, while protecting vulnerable people. The coming years will test whether the strengths or weaknesses dominate each state\u2019s approach."]}], "tstamp": 1701054941.279996}

Disordered systems require going beyond tree level to capture the effects of fluctuations.\n\n- In a disordered system, operators that look irrelevant at tree level can become relevant when disorder is taken into account. This is because disorder can enhance certain interactions through fluctuations.\n\n- Ordered systems have operators that flow to fixed points under RG. Disordered systems can flow to different types of fixed points like random fixed points where couplings remain random under RG flow.\n\n- The scaling theory breaks down in 1D disordered systems due to effects like Griffiths singularities. So standard power-law scaling of correlations no longer applies. Other approaches like the strong disorder renormalization group are used instead.\n\n- A key difference is that disorder induces randomness and fluctuations that significantly modify the operator scaling compared to the clean, ordered case. New methods beyond tree-level theory are required for disordered systems.\n\nThe effects of disorder in quantum systems and RG treatments remain an active area of research.

The key aspects are:\n\n1. Neutron creation - Neutrons are created from fission reactions when a fissile atom like U-235 absorbs a neutron and splits into fission fragments, releasing 2-3 new neutrons on average. The rate of neutron creation is proportional to the fission rate Rf.\n\n2. Neutron moderation - The high energy neutrons emitted from fission are slowed down (moderated) by collisions with light atoms like hydrogen in water or graphite moderators, converting their kinetic energy to thermal energy. This increases the neutrons' probability of causing fission. The moderation rate depends on the moderator materials and density.\n\n3. Neutron absorption - Neutrons can get absorbed by fuel atoms, control rods, reactor structural materials etc, removing them from the reactor core without causing fission. The rate of absorption Ra is proportional to neutron flux and absorption cross-sections. \n\n4. Neutron leakage - Neutrons can leak out of the core without interacting, depending on the core size and geometry. The leakage rate Rl relates to neutron speed, core size, reflection at boundaries.\n\nThe neutron population and reactor power level depends on the balance between these creation and loss processes. If neutron production exceeds losses, the neutron population and power will increase. The reactivity \u03c1 indicates if the reactor is subcritical (\u03c1 < 0), critical (\u03c1 = 0) or supercritical (\u03c1 > 0) based on the rates of these processes.

The kernel describes when two braids yield the same knot.\n- Every knot can be represented as the closure of some braid, though the braid is not unique.

Tolkien and George R.R. Martin have both created intricate fantasy worlds filled with rich histories, diverse cultures, and even constructed languages. While Tolkien's works focus on the lyrical Elvish tongues of Quenya and Sindarin, Martin's Game of Thrones presents the guttural language of the nomadic Dothraki people. Though different in sound and origins, these fabricated languages share deep linguistic and social thought behind their formation.\n\nTolkien's passion for language construction is evident in the Elvish tongues used prominently in The Lord of the Rings. The musical language of the High Elves, Quenya, was influenced by Tolkien\u2019s study of Finnish, while the more common Elvish speech of Sindarin is based on Welsh (\u201cInvented Languages\u201d 58). Tolkien took care to develop consistent phonemes, grammar, and an extensive Elvish lexicon split between the two languages that can be seen in character dialogue, poems, and place names throughout Middle Earth. As scholar Michael Adams notes, \u201cNo other fantasy writer\u2014perhaps no other writer ever\u2014has lavished such attention on the languages of his imagined world or integrated them so fully into his narratives\u201d (1). Tolkien saw language invention as part of his world-building process to create a mythical past for Europe through a fictional historical linguistics (\u201cInvented Languages\u201d 59). From the tengwar script to the use of linguistics to track Elvish language evolution, Tolkien\u2019s Elvish tongues have a sense of authenticity and history.\n\nIn contrast, the Dothraki language constructed by George R.R. Martin for his Game of Thrones books draws more from an oral tradition than written history. Created by linguist David J. Peterson for the HBO television adaptation, Dothraki follows patterns and grammar of natural languages but has a harsh sound meant to reflect the brutality of the nomadic horse warriors (\u201cHow David\u201d). As a primarily spoken language, there is no formal written component in the Dothraki tongue. The vocabulary created by Peterson focuses on the tangible needs and cultural elements of the Dothraki people including warfare, horses, weapons, food, and the natural environment (Oswalt 59). Through the Dothraki language, viewers and readers of Game of Thrones get a sense of cultural traits such as valuing honesty, constant motion, and skill in battle. While less extensive than Tolkien\u2019s Elvish, the constructed Dothraki language adds authenticity and cultural depth to Daenerys Targaryen's interactions with her khalasar. \n\nBoth Tolkien and Martin\u2019s constructed languages connect back to themes of identity, culture, and history in their fantasy works. Tolkien\u2019s Elvish languages reinforce the profound immortal history of Middle Earth and the races that inhabit it. The Dothraki language gives voice to a nomadic warrior culture where verbal communication and oaths have deep meaning. These fictional tongues ultimately serve to draw readers and viewers more fully into intricately crafted secondary worlds. Though Tolkien\u2019s passion for linguistics runs deeper, Martin\u2019s Dothraki offers another creative example of the power of language invention in speculative fiction. The rich construction and integration of these languages, whether Elvish or Dothraki, is a testament to the vital role of invented languages in fantasy worldbuilding.\n\nWorks Cited\nAdams, Michael. \u201cTolkien's Constructed Languages.\u201d J.R.R.

RNA sequencing lets scientists read the cells' instruction book to understand how cells work!\n\nThe key ideas are that cells have RNA \"instruction manuals\", sequencing means reading those instructions, and scientists use machines to help them do that reading.

Students can share facts or what they already know about some of the countries. This makes for a fun interactive activity to learn geography and introduce African countries to young learners.\n\nThe activity can be made more challenging for older grades by increasing the grid size, number of country names or using more obscure country names.

Start with a foundation LLM model like GPT-3 or Anthropic's Claude. This provides a strong starting point for natural language conversations.\n\n2. Collect a dataset of daily dialogues with the target individual over an extended time period (weeks to months). The conversations should cover a wide range of everyday topics and aim to elicit the person's perspectives, opinions, experiences etc. Record the conversations and transcribe them.\n\n3. Pre-train the LLM model on this personal dialogue dataset using self-supervised learning techniques like masked language modeling. This tunes the model to start adapting to the individual's speech patterns, vocabulary, domain knowledge etc.\n\n4. Develop a conversational agent interface that allows open-ended dialogue with the individual through text or speech. Connect this interface to the adapted LLM to power the conversations. \n\n5. Enable the agent to ask clarifying questions if it does not understand something the individual expresses. Use active learning approaches to identify areas of incomplete knowledge.\n\n6. As new conversations occur, continue to collect the dialogue transcripts. Use these to further fine-tune the LLM model incrementally on an ongoing basis. This enables the model to progressively deepen its knowledge of the individual over time.\n\n7. Evaluate the model's knowledge using personalized question answering tasks. Construct questions that rely on recall of personal facts, opinions, and events mentioned in previous conversations. Use the performance on this benchmark to quantify knowledge gains.\n\n8. Enable the model to proactively drive conversations to fill in perceived knowledge gaps through curiosity-driven dialog. Maintain an uncertainty estimate over topics and use that to guide exploration.\n\nThe end result is an agent that builds deep personalization to the individual through open-ended daily chats. The expanding conversation history allows continuous self-supervision of the underlying LLM. This amplifies recall, understanding and relevance as the interactions with the individual grow over months."]}], "tstamp": 1701055037.8010361}

Your explanation accurately describes the concept of asymptotic upper bounds and big O notation. A few key points that support the truth of this statement:\n\n- Asymptotic behavior refers to the growth rate of a function as the input size (n) increases towards infinity. It describes the limiting behavior.\n\n- We say a function f(n) has an asymptotic upper bound of g(n) if f(n) grows no faster than g(n) for sufficiently large n. This is denoted as f(n) = O(g(n)).\n\n- As an example, a quadratic function like f(n) = 3n^2 does indeed grow faster than a linear function like f(n) = 7n + 13 as n increases.\n\n- The formal definition of big O notation is that there exists some constant k such that f(n) \u2264 k\u22c5g(n) for all n past some threshold n0. This matches your explanation.\n\nSo your explanation correctly captures the formal definition of asymptotic upper bounds and provides a solid example with quadratic vs linear functions.

Here is a high-level overview of how it works:\n\n- The exact cover problem involves finding a subset of rows in a matrix that contain one and only one copy of each column. This has applications to problems like sudoku, tiling puzzles, etc.\n\n- To represent the matrix, we build a sparse matrix structure with doubly linked lists - each column is a circular linked list through all rows that contain that column. This gives us the image of columns \"dancing\" through the rows.\n\n- We then do a backtracking/recursive search to find an exact cover. At each step, we remove one node from the columns linked lists to represent a potential part of the solution. This efficiently updates all links affected.\n\n- When we remove a node, we cover its column and uncover its row. If all columns are covered with a subset of rows, we have a solution. Otherwise we recurse.\n\n- The key insights are the sparse matrix representation with doubly linked lists, allowing fast insertion/removal, and the recursive search process. By carefully managing the data structure, solutions can be found extremely efficiently.\n\nSo in summary, it's a clever mix of a linked data representation, allowing backtracking search, to solve the combinatorial exact cover problem space efficiently."]}], "tstamp": 1701054135.4617045}

Do you like watching birds? There are so many different kinds flying around - big ones, small ones, colorful ones. Understanding birds better can help us appreciate them more. Let's learn about our feathered friends!\n\nWhat Makes a Bird a Bird\nBirds are a type of animal that have some special features not found in other animals:\n- Feathers - Birds are covered in feathers instead of fur or scales. Feathers help them fly and keep warm.\n- Wings - The front limbs of birds have evolved into wings. The wings have long flight feathers that let birds soar through the air.\n- Beaks - Birds have beaks instead of mouths and teeth. Beaks come in many shapes and sizes for different diets.\n- Lightweight skeletons - A bird's bones are hollow, making their bodies lightweight so they can fly more easily.\n\nThese special adaptations allow birds to fly, which most other animals cannot do. Scientists classify animals with these traits as birds. There are around 10,000 different species or types of birds worldwide!\n\nOn the Inside: Bird Bodies\nSince birds evolved for flight, many parts of their body have adapted to make them lighter and more aerodynamic. Their bones are hollow with crisscrossing struts inside that provide strength without as much weight. They have air sacs throughout their body that connect to their lungs and make breathing more efficient.\n\nWhile birds don't have teeth, they have very strong gizzard muscles that grind up and digest their food. Their cardiovascular systems efficiently deliver oxygen; their hearts beat much faster than ours! All these systems work together to give birds the energy they need for flying.\n\nBird Behavior and Habits \nDifferent bird species behave in different ways. Songbirds like cardinals and finches use their voices to communicate. Birds of prey like eagles and hawks hunt for food. Water birds like ducks and geese float gracefully and dive underwater to find plants and fish to eat. \n\nMany birds migrate, meaning they fly very long distances to move between habitats. Tiny hummingbirds migrate hundreds of miles! Arctic terns have the longest migration, flying from the Arctic to Antarctica and back every year. Scientists still don't fully understand how they navigate these incredibly long journeys.\n\nBirds build nests to lay their eggs and raise baby birds. Nests can be burrows in the ground, holes in trees, woven cups, mounds of vegetation, or even floating on water. Both male and female parents care for the hatchlings by bringing food and protecting the nest.\n\nProtecting Our Feathered Friends\nBirds face many threats from humans like habitat loss and climate change. We can help birds by:\n\n- Installing bird feeders, nest boxes, and bird baths.\n- Growing native plants that provide food and shelter.  \n- Keeping cats indoors so they don't kill birds.\n- Using less plastic and properly disposing of trash so birds don't get tangled or choke.\n- Supporting parks, nature preserves, and conservation areas.\n\nFollowing these tips will help the birds around us stay happy and healthy! Understanding birds better allows us to appreciate the many unique abilities they have. Next time you see a bird soaring overhead, listen for its song, or find a feather on the ground, think about our amazing feathered friends!"]}], "tstamp": 1701055258.7240996}

Here is a formal definition and explanation:\n\nA dual number takes the form z = x + \u03b5y, where x and y are real numbers and \u03b5 is a nilpotent element satisfying \u03b5^2 = 0. The dual number extends the real numbers by adjoining one new element \u03b5 with the property that its square is 0.\n\nWe can define arithmetic on dual numbers as follows:\n\n(x1 + \u03b5y1) + (x2 + \u03b5y2) = (x1 + x2) + \u03b5(y1 + y2) \n\n(x1 + \u03b5y1) * (x2 + \u03b5y2) = (x1*x2) + \u03b5(x1*y2 + x2*y1)\n\nThe main application of dual numbers is in automatic differentiation. The key insight is that the derivative of a function f(x) at the point x can be found by evaluating f(x + \u03b5) and looking at the \u03b5 coefficient. \n\nFor example, suppose f(x) = x^2. Then:\n\nf(x + \u03b5) = (x + \u03b5)^2 \n           = (x^2) + \u03b5(2x)\n\nThe coefficient of the \u03b5 term is 2x, which we recognize as the derivative f'(x). By manipulating functions of dual numbers, we can automatically compute derivatives without needing to manually take limits or apply the chain rule. This allows easy implementation of reverse mode automatic differentiation in computer programs."]}], "tstamp": 1701054603.2782972}

Some key economic activities that illustrate this include:\n\n- Production - transforming raw materials and other inputs into finished goods and services that have value for consumers. For example, a bakery producing breads and pastries.\n\n- Distribution - getting finished goods and services from producers to consumers. For example, a grocery store distributing food products to customers. \n\n- Consumption - the use of goods and services to satisfy people's wants and needs. For example, a family buying groceries and preparing meals.\n\nGoods are tangible products that satisfy people's wants and needs, while services are intangible activities that do the same. Both require resources to produce and provide some kind of value or utility for consumers. Their unique roles drive economic activities.\n\nThe five key economic principles and their purposes are:\n\n1. Scarcity - Resources are limited in relation to people's wants and needs. This drives production and trade as people try to use scarce resources efficiently.\n\n2. Opportunity Cost - The value of the next best alternative given up when making a decision. This helps assess trade-offs of choices. \n\n3. Efficiency - Achieving the maximum output and outcomes from limited scarce resources. This guides decisions on resource allocation.\n\n4. Equity - Fairness in distributing economic prosperity and burdens throughout society. This considers ethical outcomes for different groups.\n\n5. Economic Growth - Increasing production and consumption of goods and services over time. This considers how policies affect long-run trajectories.\n\nThe four main economic resources are:\n\n1. Land - Natural resources like minerals, timber, water sources. Needed for space, raw materials, agriculture.\n\n2. Labor - Human effort and skill applied to production. Needed to transform inputs into outputs.\n\n3. Capital - Produced goods like machinery, facilities, tools used in production. Needed to increase productivity. \n\n4. Entrepreneurship - Human innovation, creativity and risk-taking in business. Needed for organizing the other resources.\n\nThese resources allow businesses to produce and market goods and services. Pricing, profits and competitive positioning depend partly on access to and costs of economic resources. If resource prices rise or supplies tighten, companies may charge more or earn less profit on sales. Resource constraints can also limit what firms can produce and sell.\n\nLooking at my smartphone, the five economic utilities are:\n\n1. Form Utility - Manufacturing components and assembling the phone\n2. Place Utility - Transporting and distributing the phone to retail stores \n3. Time Utility - Having the phone available when consumers want to purchase it\n4. Possession Utility - Allowing ownership and use of the phone\n5. Service Utility - Providing functionality like communications for consumers\n\nThese utilities require various production stages and marketing activities like R&D, advertising, sales promotions and after-purchase service. The more utilities generated, the more viable and valuable the product.\n\nA business owner launches a new food product. At first there is scarcity as they are the sole supplier to local customers. The owner must choose how much to produce given limited resources. As demand grows faster than their production capacity, they face more scarcity allocating products among customers. To increase supply, they must sacrifice alternatives like leisure time and use those resources expand production. The interactions between supply and demand decisions continue as the market develops."]}], "tstamp": 1701055193.323363}

This allows handling of typos, missing characters etc. The matching works well for small typos or variations in reasonably sized text and substrings.\n\nSome parameters like match thresholds could also be tuned further based on the use case. But this basic implementation demonstrates the approximate string matching functionality."]}], "tstamp": 1701054807.986488}

This is where you'll define the ligature substitutions.\n\n3. For each ligature glyph you want to set custom caret positions for, add a substitution rule mapping the individual letters to the ligature. For example `f_f_i -> ffi`.\n\n4. In the glyph editor, select the ligature glyph (e.g. ffi) and open the OpenType panel.\n\n5. Under Caret Positions, click the plus button to add caret positions.\n\n6.

Rather, he caused the death of Margaret, who had not given any provocation to Steve.\n\n3) Causing the death of any other person by mistake or accident would have provided Steve a defense against a murder charge. However, Margaret's death was not caused by mistake or accident. It was an intentional act by Steve.\n\nIn summary, Steve intentionally caused Margaret's death despite Margaret not provoking him. His act does not fall under any of the exceptions that would have made it culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Therefore, as per the stated legal provisions, Steve should be convicted of murder."]}], "tstamp": 1701054800.758323}

This keeps it separate from your production server.\n\n2. Use a build server: Have a separate \"build\" server that is more powerful and solely meant for tasks like this. Mount your app on it over NFS when you need to precompile assets.\n\n3. Docker: Build a Docker image that matches your production environment and run the asset precompilation inside it on your local machine or a cloud server.\n\n4. Remote SSH with sync: SSH into a more powerful remote server and mount your production code over SSHFS. Rsync assets back down after precompilation.\n\n5. Cloud machine: Spin up a more powerful cloud server (AWS, GCP etc) temporarily to precompile the assets, then copy them back down to your production server.\n\nThe SSHFS and chroot method can work, but is a bit convoluted.

Unbeknownst to the simple bovine, its digestive system was home to trillions of busy bacterial ribosomes, the protein-making factories that allowed the bacteria to grow and thrive. One particular ribosome belonged to a rare strain of E. coli that possessed the unique ability to incorporate traces of the cow's last meal - wildflowers from the fields of France - into the proteins it produced. \n\nThis happy ribosome went about its work without care, churning out beautiful proteins that shone like jewels with the dazzling colors of poppies, cornflowers, and lilies woven into their structure. Until one fateful day, it produced a vivid purple protein that was hailed as the most stunning ever seen within the microbial community. Word of this discovery reached the notorious microbiome mob boss, Vito Bacteroides. Bacteroides wanted that visionary ribosome for himself, hoping to use it to create proteins that would bedazzle all his bacterial associates.\n\nSo Bacteroides sent out a hit squad to kidnap the cow's celebrity ribosome and bring it back to his layer. But the ribosome refused to cooperate with its gangster captors. It went on strike, halting all protein production in protest. The other gut microbes, who relied on the ribosome's proteins for sustenance, began to starve. They sent messages across the intestinal telegraph, tapping out their distress in biochemical code. The cow itself began to suffer without its essential gut bacteria. It stopped eating and mooed pathetically, alarming the old farmer who tended the cows. \n\nAs the cow's condition worsened, the farmer rode into the village seeking a physician. But the doctor had recently fled for fear of the Jacobin mobs beginning to gather there. Enraged at both the absent doctor and the incompetent King who had allowed such discord, the farmer travelled directly to Paris to demand justice. His impassioned pleas sparked outrage amongst the urban peasants. Within days, the storming of the Bastille began, marking the start of the French Revolution itself!\n\nAnd so the humble ribosome, just by doing its job and making beautiful proteins, set in motion a series of events that led from the depths of a cow's microbiome to the overthrow of the French monarchy. Though strange, this tale illuminates the interconnectedness of all living beings, great and small. Our actions, no matter how insignificant they seem, can have consequences that resonate through time and space to change the course of history itself. The bacterial ribosome and the French Revolution may inhabit different worlds, but their fates were linked nonetheless in the end."]}], "tstamp": 1701054366.4710429}

Aircraft from Admiral Halsey's 3rd Fleet carriers struck Japanese airfields on Negros, Panay, Cebu, and Leyte to establish air superiority prior to the invasion of Leyte. This long-range carrier air strike exemplified a far battle approach. The strikes were coordinated at the fleet level, representing structured coordination. \n\nThe Battle of the Sibuyan Sea on October 24th was a hybrid close-far battle with elements of structured and melee coordination. Admiral Kurita\u2019s Japanese Center Force was attacked in the Sibuyan Sea by planes from Admiral Halsey\u2019s carriers in a far battle exchange. However, the Musashi was sunk during intense air attacks, representing close battle damage. Coordination was structured on the American side but turned to melee on the Japanese side due to communications issues aboard Musashi and other ships.\n\nThe Battle of Surigao Strait on October 25th was a close battle with melee coordination. Admiral Nishimura's Southern Force, lacking air cover, exchanged fire with Rear Admiral Jesse Oldendorf's bombardment group at ranges as close as 3.5 nautical miles, sinking the Fuso and Yamashiro. Naval doctrine was ignored by Nishimura who charged recklessly into the strait, representing pure melee tactics.  \n\nThe Battle off Samar on October 25th was a close battle with melee coordination. Admiral Kurita\u2019s Center Force, having passed through San Bernardino Strait, encountered Admiral Clifton Sprague\u2019s small escort carrier group in the morning darkness by chance. The Japanese capital ships unleashed heavy fire on the lightly armed carriers from as close as 9,000 yards in a wild melee action before disengaging.\n\nThe Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o on October 25th was a far battle with structured coordination. Admiral Ozawa\u2019s Northern Force decoyed Admiral Halsey\u2019s 3rd Fleet carriers away from Samar in a series of long-range air and surface actions. The Americans took the bait, pursuing Ozawa\u2019s carriers northward with coordinated strikes over hundreds of miles, leaving San Bernardino Strait unguarded. This structured coordination played into Kurita and Ozawa\u2019s overall operation plan.\n\nIn summary, the multi-prong naval battles off Leyte featured both close aboard and long-distance combat. Structured coordination was generally evident in the wide-ranging carrier duels, while many surface engagements turned to chaotic melee actions as command and control broke down. The Japanese relied on complex coordination between geographically separate naval groups, while the Americans leveraged their carrier aviation arm which could strike at long distances.

And banks were doing tricky things to make more money from those loans. At the same time, homes were getting very expensive, so people were borrowing bigger loans that were riskier.\n\nThen housing prices started going down, and people who had big loans couldn't sell their homes for enough money to pay the banks back. Many people defaulted on their loans, meaning they just stopped paying them. \n\nThis caused big problems for the banks, because they weren't getting their money back but they had lent out so much money. Some banks even went out of business. And when banks are in trouble, they stop lending money to people and businesses who need it.\n\nSo the financial system started having big problems that spread through the economy. Businesses couldn't borrow money, people lost jobs as companies earned less money, and investors lost a lot of money in the stock market.

Decide on the gem name and functionality. For this example, let's create a gem called \"my_math\" that provides some basic math functions.\n\n2. Set up the gem structure using `bundle gem my_math`. This creates the standard directory structure for a gem.\n\n3. Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Each class and module should have one responsibility only. Create separate classes for separate functionality:\n\n```ruby\n# my_math/lib/my_math/addition.rb\nmodule MyMath\n  class Addition\n    def self.add(a, b)\n      a + b\n    end\n  end \nend\n\n# my_math/lib/my_math/multiplication.rb\nmodule MyMath\n  class Multiplication\n    def self.multiply(a, b)\n      a * b \n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n4. Apply the Open/Closed Principle (OCP). Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. Allow new functionality to be added via new classes, not by modifying existing classes.\n\n5. Use the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP). Subclass objects should be substitutable for their parent classes without errors. Use abstraction to ensure this.\n\n6. Follow the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP). Split interfaces into smaller ones with specific functionality rather than one large interface. Each class only implements the methods it needs.\n\n7. Apply the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). Depend on abstractions rather than concretions. Use interfaces and inheritance to decouple dependencies.\n\n8.

Use a long field in your Kotlin class to store a pointer to the C struct. When you call from Kotlin into your C code, pass this pointer for the C code to access the struct.\n\n2. Define the C struct in your Kotlin class using `Struct.pack()` and `Struct.unpack()`. This serializes the struct into a byte array that you can pass to C. The C code can then deserialize it back into a struct.\n\n3. Define a native method in your Kotlin class that returns a pointer to the C struct. Store this pointer in a `jlong` field in your Kotlin class. Pass this pointer to other native methods to access the internal state of the struct.\n\n4. Use a ByteBuffer and define native methods to read/write struct fields from/to the ByteBuffer contents. The ByteBuffer essentially serves as your struct storage.\n\nThe key is mapping a C struct to some storage in the Kotlin class, whether a pointer, byte array, or ByteBuffer.

This generally requires informed consent.\n\n- Therefore, waiving informed consent would be inconsistent with the Belmont Report's respect for persons principle and thus would not be permitted under \u00a7.101(i) even if an Agency head invoked that waiver provision. \n\n- While an Agency head could potentially waive the IRB review requirement alone under \u00a7.101(i), they cannot waive both IRB review and informed consent given the Belmont Report restrictions now referenced in the Revised Rule.\n\nSo in short, while some flexibility is given to Agencies, waiving core protections like consent for invasive research would clearly violate compelling participant protections and ethical principles safeguarded by the Revised Common Rule.

Phrases like \"coat of fire over towns\" and \"white roads will flow with blood\" convey the death and destruction that accompanied this westward march. \n\nYet the poem also celebrates the steadfastness and determination of the Soviet troops. Despite the \"assaults, battles and river crossings,\" nothing could \"overhelm\" the Soviet army. The line \"Stalin's eagle has arrived\" likens the army to a powerful eagle arriving in Warsaw, evoking Soviet strength and pride.\n\nThe poem has strong patriotic overtones as well. Warsaw is described as the Soviet army's \"dear, family home\" indicating a close, familial bond. The birch trees and guelder roses, icons of the Russian landscape, welcome the soldiers back after their long absence. Marshal Rokossovsky embodies this homecoming, walking again on his \"only, native soil\" after many years away at war.\n\nIn this way, the poem frames the Soviet march to Warsaw not only as a military campaign, but as a nationalist struggle to liberate an almost sacred homeland. Using natural imagery and familial language, it glorifies the heroic sacrifice required to push back the German invasion and restore Soviet control over Poland after long years of conflict."]}], "tstamp": 1701055113.8229556}

This means the ice cubes are much colder than the water.\n\n- When you put ice cubes in water, the ice cubes absorb heat from the surrounding water, cooling it down. This makes the surface temperature of the cup in contact with the water become much colder as well.\n\n- However, the air temperature right above the water stays roughly the same. This temperature difference causes water vapor in the warmer air to condense on the colder ceramic cup surfaces that are in contact with the icy water.\n\n- This condensed water on the bottom and sides of the cup makes it feel very wet. Without ice cubes, the water temperature stays closer to room temperature, so less condensation occurs.\n\nIn summary, it's the greater temperature difference between the icy water and air when adding ice cubes that leads to more condensation and water droplets forming on the cup itself, making the bottom wetter.

Some key aspects of QFT include:\n\n- Fields and Particles: QFT views particles as excited states of an underlying quantum field that fills space and time. Different types of particles correspond to different types of fields. (Peskin & Schroeder, 1995)  \n\n- Quantization: The fields are quantized, meaning field amplitudes are restricted to discrete values and can be created/destroyed in quanta or particles. This builds on the concept of wave-particle duality. (Schwartz, 2014)\n\n- Relativistic Invariance: QFT equations and systems must be relativistically invariant, adhering to principles of special relativity like causality. This results in concepts like antiparticles. (Duncan, 2012)\n\n- Interactions as Exchange of Particles: Interactions between particles are described as an exchange of quantum of the fields between them, e.g. photons between electrons for electromagnetic interaction. (Peskin & Schroeder, 1995)\n\nSome key theoretical frameworks in QFT include relativistic quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics (QED), electroweak theory, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and the standard model of particle physics. Advanced topics include renormalization, renormalization group flow, quantum gauge theories, path integrals, and spontaneous symmetry breaking. \n\nAs you can see, there is a vast landscape to cover in quantum field theory.

Here's a high-level overview:\n\nStatistical modelling: A representation refers to how the model captures the relationship between variables. This could be a simple linear relationship, a complex neural network, or something in between. The choice of representation impacts what kinds of patterns the model can capture.\n\nCognitive process modelling: A representation refers to how knowledge is encoded in the mind or in a cognitive model. For example, a conceptual representation encodes knowledge about a concept and its relationships to other concepts. Representations impact processing - how easily concepts can be retrieved, combined, and reasoned about.\n\nGenerative modelling: A representation refers to how a model captures the complex, high-dimensional distributions of real-world data like images or text. The representation is what the model uses to generate new examples. Different representations have different capacities for modeling the intricate regularities in the data.\n\nThe notion of embedding is related but distinct. An embedding refers specifically to representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space, typically for easier processing and pattern detection, as done in techniques like word2vec. So an embedding creates a representation of the data that preserves important relationships while reducing dimensionality. Both notions aim to capture structure, but representation is a more general term.\n\nIn summary, while nuanced by context, at their core these notions of representation refer to how models capture patterns - whether they be statistical relationships, conceptual knowledge, or data distributions. Embeddings are one specific approach to finding representations. The choice of representation shapes what can be modeled or generated."]}], "tstamp": 1701055126.2670174}

Integrate with internal tools\n    - Connect chatbot to internal knowledge base, wikis, project tracking tools via APIs\n    - Allow chatbot to query these sources to answer questions\n    - Support single sign-on from internal tools to chatbot\n\n5. Test and get feedback \n    - Do internal demos and collect feedback on usefulness, accuracy, suggestions\n    - Fine-tune questions, responses, dialogs based on feedback\n    - Add more integrations if needed to expand knowledge\n\n6. Launch pilot chatbot\n    - Start with most active internal teams to test at smaller scale \n    - Slowly expand access to more teams/departments\n    - Gather usage data and feedback from pilot \n\n7.

Collect training data: Gather a diverse dataset of well-produced tracks in the styles you want to emulate (Daft Punk, Beatles, Mac Demarco, etc.). These will be used to train the AI models. Ensure you have the rights to use the tracks.\n\n2. Identify key parameters: Determine what mixing, mastering and EQ parameters you want the AI plugin to control. These could include things like EQ bands, compressor/limiter thresholds, reverb size, etc.\n\n3. Create ML models: Train machine learning models to analyze the audio and make adjustments to the parameters you identified to match the overall sound/style of the training data. Neural networks would be well-suited for this.\n\n4. Build plugin framework: Use a plugin SDK like JUCE to build the VST plugin shell. This handles loading the ML models, linking the GUI controls, audio input/output, and parameter changes.\n\n5. Integrate models: Import your trained ML models into the plugin and connect the prediction outputs to dynamically adjust plugin parameters.\n\n6. Calibrate and test: Thoroughly test the plugin with various audio inputs, calibrating the models and parameters as needed until it reliably emulates the desired production style categories.\n\nThe key is having sufficient high-quality training data that exemplifies the stylistic qualities you want your AI assistant to learn. Over time, as you use the plugin, you could even fine-tune the models to better match your personal preferences."]}], "tstamp": 1701055090.205177}

This allows for new gene combinations and can increase the rate at which adaptation occurs. Especially in changing environments, increased genetic diversity allows some offspring to be better suited to new conditions. Additionally, sexual reproduction purges deleterious mutations as they are exposed to selection in new genetic backgrounds. The shuffling of genes also resets some epigenetic markers each generation, potentially allowing more phenotypic plasticity.\n\nAsexual reproduction through mechanisms like vegetative propagation produces genetically identical clones. This allows well-adapted genotypes to persist across generations without any genetic dilution. It can be useful for maintaining locally adapted gene complexes. Asexually propagated plants also maintain their existing epigenetic markers, allowing for transgenerational plasticity as epialleles respond to environmental cues. This epigenetic inheritance across clones can prime them for prevailing local conditions.\n\nIn variable or changing environments, plants capable of both modes can strike a balance - using asexual propagation to persist locally adapted genotypes while introducing sexual recombination and genetic diversity at times to provide genetic variation and adaptability to respond to changes in selective pressures. The interplay between genetic and epigenetic inheritance systems allows plant populations to harness phenotypic plasticity while also exploring genotypic diversity through recombination when needed."]}], "tstamp": 1701055195.3982308}

It's about a 90 minute ride. Get off at Walchensee station. From there, hike about 30 minutes through the forest to the northern banks of the Walchensee lake. Beautiful clear blue water and surrounded by mountains and trees. Not too many tourists find this spot.\n\nSylvensteinspeicher\n- Take bus #9562 from Lenggries station, about 1 hour by train south of Munich, to Fall. From there it's a 30 minute forest hike to the shore of the reservoir. Very scenic with hardly any visitors. Pack a picnic!\n\nBreitenbrunn Lake\n- From Munich main station take bus #963 to Breitenbrunn Bahnhof. From there walk 20 minutes to the idyllic Breitenbrunn lake. Quiet spot for swimming surrounded by the Bavarian countryside. Families often bbq here in the summer.\n\nBarmsee\n- Take the train from Munich to Murnau, about 1 hour. In Murnau switch to bus #9660 towards Oberammergau alpine road. Get off at Barmsee, last stop. Beautiful smaller lake situated right among the foothills of the Alps. 30 mins walk gets you to some isolated swimming and sunbathing spots.\n\nHope this gives you some ideas to explore the natural swimming spots in the region with your family!

Look for any readable text strings, pointers to known display functions, or other clues about its structure.\n\n3. Check if the manufacturer provides any documentation or specs on the file format. Chinese smartwatches often use custom proprietary formats, but some clues may be available.\n\n4. Try decompiling the file with a disassembler like Ghidra. This will translate the binary into assembly code which may be more readable. Look for initialization code and references to display driver functions.\n\n5. If possible, compare with bin files from the same smartwatch model that have minor differences, like alternate watchface designs. Identify where they differ to reverse engineer the image encoding. \n\n6. Check communities and forums related to that smartwatch or chipset to see if anyone has already reverse engineered similar files or can offer insights.\n\n7. Use trial and error by modifying the bin file and loading onto the watch to see the effects. This can help associate certain parts of the file with certain watchface elements.\n\nThe process involves making incremental discoveries about the file format to determine how the watchface data and graphics are stored.
