Begin by creating an empty list called \"sorted_list\" that will store the sorted integers.\n2. Initialize a variable \"n\" to represent the length of the input list, which is 100 in this case.\n3. Create a loop that iterates \"n\" times, where \"n\" is the length of the input list.\n   a. Inside the loop, find the smallest integer in the input list.\n   b. Remove the smallest integer from the input list.\n   c. Append the smallest integer to the \"sorted_list\".\n4. After the loop has completed \"n\" iterations, the \"sorted_list\" will contain all integers from the input list in ascending order.\n5. Return the \"sorted_list\" as the output."]}], "tstamp": 1699423458.8619273}
