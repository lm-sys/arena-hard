We want to show that set $A$ is equal to $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap (C - B))$ for any arbitrary sets $B$. By Lemma 1 the set $A$ is equal to $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A - B)$ for any arbitrary set $B$. Then by Lemma 2 the set $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A - B)$ is equal to $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap (C - B))$. Therefore with transitivity the set $A$ is equal to $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap (C - B))$. Now conversely suppose $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap (C - B)) = A$. By Lemma 1 the set $A$ is equal to $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A - B)$. Therefore again with transitivity, the set $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap (C - B))$ is equal to $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A - B)$. If we remove the subset $A \\cap B$ from both expressions then we end up with $(A \\cap (C - B)) = (A - B)$. Therefore by Lemma 2 the set $A$ is a subset of the set $C$, completing the proof.

A AA battery is is rated at 1.5v output electric potential and 0-700 mA output current.\nThe basic operation of the heating element is to use 1 AA battery.

It finally catches up to her when she suffers a collapse right on the stairs due to respiratory distress. Not only does Gloria lose consciousness, she sustains some injuries during the fall, though nothing too serious. As she is transported to hospital, her condition is deemed quite series.
